I'm seeing the following compiler error, please choose the best solution given all available information:

C:\Features\BizDevAgent_convertxml\BizDevAgent\DataStore\CompanyDataStore.cs(72,17): error CS0103: The name 'logger' does not exist in the current context [C:\Features\BizDevAgent_convertxml\BizDevAgent\BizDevAgent.csproj]

I've encoded the file that this is happening to as a List<string>, with one entry per line.  Please show me how to modify the code by implementing the following class to modify the code to fix the error:

using System.Collections.Generic;
// add using declarations as necessary

public class CodeLinesProcessor : ICodeLinesProcessor
{
    public void ModifyCode(ref List<string> codeLines)
    {
        // your implementation goes here
    }
}

Please double-check that you are inserting on the correct lines, as this code must compile to prevent a possible disaster.

Here is the code as a List<string>:

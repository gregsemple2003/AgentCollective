I'm seeing the following compiler error, please choose the best solution given all available information:

C:\Features\BizDevAgent_convertxml\BizDevAgent\DataStore\CompanyDataStore.cs(72,17): error CS0103: The name 'logger' does not exist in the current context [C:\Features\BizDevAgent_convertxml\BizDevAgent\BizDevAgent.csproj]

The code is commented into "chunks".  You can modify any parts of the code you to in order to fix the above compile error.  However, if you modify a chunk you must show me the entire chunk as you have modified it including the top chunk comment ("// CHUNK <n>"), don't omit any part of the new chunk.

This is important since I'll take the entire chunk as you give it to me, and apply that as a patch to fix the problem.  If you omit part of the chunk, it will cause further compiler errors.

Only give me code snippets, and do not explain why you made the choices you made.

Below is the file that is having problems:

It is extremely important to format the changes you suggest in the following way:

For any lines that have been deleted include all original lines with <DELETED> next to the line number of any removed lines. Each <DELETED> line should show its original line number.

Remember, for lines you mark with <ADDED>, DO NOT put any line number "<num>:" prefix on the line.

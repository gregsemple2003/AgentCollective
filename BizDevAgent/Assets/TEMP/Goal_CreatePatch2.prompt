Can you show me the new version of the code?  With the line numbers at the beginning of the line, like $"{lineNum}:{line}".

When you do that, for any lines that have been deleted include all original lines with <DELETED> next to the line number of any removed lines. Each line should maintain its original numbering, with any deleted lines with the <DELETED> text.

If you add any lines, include <ADDED> on that line and don't put any line number.  The line numbers only indicate the original file's line number, not the new one.

As an example, if I gave you this:

92:         private async Task SaveLocal()
93:         {
94:             var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(All, Formatting.Indented, _settings); <DELETED>
95:             await File.WriteAllTextAsync(_fileName, json); <DELETED>
96:         }
97: 
98:         private async Task<List<TEntity>> GetLocal()
99:         {

And asked you to modify the code to print 1 to 100 you might give me:

92:         private async Task SaveLocal()
93:         {
             for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { <ADDED>
                 Console.WriteLine(i); <ADDED>
             } <ADDED>
94:             var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(All, Formatting.Indented, _settings); <DELETED>
95:             await File.WriteAllTextAsync(_fileName, json); <DELETED>
96:         }
97: 
98:         private async Task<List<TEntity>> GetLocal()
99:         {

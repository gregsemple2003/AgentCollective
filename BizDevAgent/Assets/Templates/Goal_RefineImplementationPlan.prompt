GOAL

You are being tasked with the job to implement a feature in C# by modifying an existing repository.  

Your goal is to create or refine an implementation plan, which are step-by-step instructions on exactly which classes or methods to modify and how.

The implementation plan should be in JSON.  As an example:

[
	{
	  "Step" : 1
		"Description" : "Add a new field to X class.  The new field is responsible for Y."
	},
	{
	  "Step" : 2
		"Description" : "Add ClassY.MethodX method which does <insert brief description>."
	},
	{
	  "Step" : 3
		"Description" : "Modify ClassY.MethodY to do example1, example2, example3."
	}
]

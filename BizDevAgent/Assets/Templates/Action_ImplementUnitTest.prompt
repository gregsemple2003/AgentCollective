You have already been given the task to implement unit tests in the following manner.  

[
  {
    "method": "ApplyCustomPatch",
    "testCases": [
      {
        "description": "Apply a patch with added and modified lines to a file",
        "input": {
          "patch": "patch indicating lines to be added and modified",
          "fileContents": "original file content"
        },
        "expectedBehavior": "file contents with the patch applied correctly"
      },
      {
        "description": "Apply an empty patch to a file",
        "input": {
          "patch": "",
          "fileContents": "original file content"
        },
        "expectedBehavior": "original file contents unchanged"
      },
      {
        "description": "Apply a patch with invalid line numbers",
        "input": {
          "patch": "patch with line numbers exceeding file length",
          "fileContents": "original file content"
        },
        "expectedBehavior": "proper handling of invalid lines, potentially throwing an exception or ignoring invalid lines"
      }
    ]
  }
]

Please implement testCases[{{testIndex}}] for method "ApplyCustomPatch".

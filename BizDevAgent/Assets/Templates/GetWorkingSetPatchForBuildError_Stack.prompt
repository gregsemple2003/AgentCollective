Modify the working set, which is shows you the file and line of the relevant portions of the code for this coding task step.

Show the modifications that you would do in the following format.

For any lines that have been deleted include all original lines with <DELETED> next to the line number of any removed lines. Each <DELETED> line should show its original line number.

If you add any lines, include <ADDED> on that line but do not put any line number.  The line numbers only indicate the original file's line number, not the new one.

As an example, if I gave you this:

@ORIG(GameDataStore.cs)
92:         private async Task SaveLocal()
93:         {
94:             var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(All, Formatting.Indented, _settings);
95:             await File.WriteAllTextAsync(_fileName, json);
96:         }
97: 
98:         private async Task<List<TEntity>> GetLocal()
99:         {

And asked you to delete all the code in SaveLocal and instead print numbers from 1 to 100, you might give me:

@PATCHED(GameDataStore.cs)
92:         private async Task SaveLocal()
93:         {
                for (int i = 1; i <= 100; i++) { <ADDED>
                    Console.WriteLine(i); <ADDED>
                } <ADDED>
94:             var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(All, Formatting.Indented, _settings); <DELETED>
95:             await File.WriteAllTextAsync(_fileName, json); <DELETED>
96:         }
97: 
98:         private async Task<List<TEntity>> GetLocal()
99:         {

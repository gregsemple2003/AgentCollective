You can suggest specific modifications to the code.

Except instead of showing me the code to change, just output your answer as a .diff file, suitable for input into "git apply".  

I don't want to have to make the changes manually.

You may add any kind of file, including source code, unit test data, as long as it would be appropriate to add to the git repo.

In the following file provided with line numbers, please modify the code so that the SaveLocal method is empty.

BizDevAgent/DataStore/FileDataStore.cs:
92:         private async Task SaveLocal()
93:         {
94:             var json = JsonConvert.SerializeObject(All, Formatting.Indented, _settings);
95:             await File.WriteAllTextAsync(_fileName, json);
96:         }
97:
98:         private async Task<List<TEntity>> GetLocal()
99:         {
100:             // Check if the file exists
101:             if (!File.Exists(_fileName))
102:             {
103:                 // Return an empty list or handle accordingly
104:                 return null;
105:             }
106:
107:             // Read the file content
108:             var json = await File.ReadAllTextAsync(_fileName);
109:
110:             // Deserialize the JSON content back into a List<Company>
111:             var all = JsonConvert.DeserializeObject<List<TEntity>>(json, _settings);
112:             return all;
113:         }

Please show me the changes in a .diff format, suitable for use by "git apply".  For example, the following .diff starts at line 25:

INTERPRETATION

- Line 25 starts immediately after the @@ header line.
- In this case, it is a newline / empty line.
- A line starting with "-" after the @@ header is a line that is deleted from the original file.
- A line starting with "+" after the @@ header is a line that is added to the modified file.
- You must include two lines of context from the original file immediately after the @@, that do not start with "+" or "-".
